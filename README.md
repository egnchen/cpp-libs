# cpp-libs
My header-only cpp libraries

These headers are C++17 compliant handly libraries written by me. If you want to use those, just copy the header file, include it and you're good to go.

* `hwstat.h`: Low-overhead, multi-thread friendly performance counters. Support user-defined stats and pretty-printing.
* `args.h`: A command line argument parser. Support all primitives and enums, fully declarative & constexpr.
* `thread_pool.h`: A thread pool implementation.
